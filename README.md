[00:04.46] A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on the farm
[00:09.11] A boy filled with wanderlust who really meant no harm
[00:13.86] He changed his clothes and shined his boots
[00:16.58] And combed his dark hair down
[00:18.86] And his mother cried as he walked out
[00:37.36] 
[00:22.45] "Don't take your guns to town, son
[00:25.73] Leave your guns at home, Bill
[00:28.84] Don't take your guns to town"
[00:43.34] 
[00:35.90] He laughed and kissed his mom and said, "Your Billy Joe's a man
[00:41.88] I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can
[00:47.24] But I wouldn't shoot without a cause, I'd gun nobody down"
[00:52.59] But she cried again as he rode away
[01:10.09] 
[00:57.43] "Don't take your guns to town, son
[01:00.58] Leave your guns at home, Bill
[01:03.81] Don't take your guns to town"
[01:18.31] 
[01:10.76] He sang a song as on he rode, his guns hung at his hips
[01:16.35] He rode into a cattle town, a smile upon his lips
[01:21.76] He stopped and walked into a bar and laid his money down
[01:27.32] But his mother's words echoed again
[01:44.82] 
[01:31.85] "Don't take your guns to town, son
[01:35.23] Leave your guns at home, Bill
[01:38.72] Don't take your guns to town"
[01:53.22] 
[01:46.04] He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand
[01:51.50] And tried to tell himself at last he had become a man
[01:56.70] A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
[02:02.11] And he heard again his mother's words
[02:20.61] 
[02:07.22] "Don't take your guns to town, son
[02:10.73] Leave your guns at home, Bill
[02:14.29] Don't take your guns to town"
[02:28.79] 
[02:21.58] Filled with rage, then Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
[02:26.68] But the stranger drew his gun and fired before he even saw
[02:32.05] As Billy Joe fell to the floor, the crowd all gathered 'round
[02:37.40] And wondered at his final words
[02:52.90] 
[02:41.84] "Don't take your guns to town, son
[02:45.74] Leave your guns at home, Bill
[02:49.76] Don't take your guns to town"
